4. Project Definition 
The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for accurate 
and timely health data analysis. ABC Health Analytics Company recognizes the significance of 
leveraging data to understand and respond to the evolving challenges posed by the pandemic. 
In this context, the company is initiating a project aimed at comprehensive data analysis and 
visualization of COVID-19 datasets using Python. The goal of this capstone project is to perform 
a comprehensive analysis of worldwide COVID-19 data. We will leverage data visualization 
techniques using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset used for 
this analysis is sourced from “Our World in Data” and contains information on various COVID19 metrics across different countries. 
 
Here you’ll focus on Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn aspects to understand, analyse, and
visualise the data. 
 
5. Project Task List 
For the above case study, perform the following project activities: 
 
 Activity 1: Data Loading and Exploration 
Initializing the analysis by loading and exploring the dataset, ensuring data integrity and 
format consistency for accurate downstream analysis. 
1. Load the COVID-19 DataFrame using pandas from the provided dataset files. 
2. Display the first 5 and last 5 rows of the DataFrame. 
3. Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on a strategy to handle them.
4. Remove the columns with more than 90% of missing values.
5. Convert the 'date' column to the datetime data type. 
 
 Activity 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering 
Enhancing data relevance and structure, enabling focused analysis on key COVID-19 
indicators and demographic factors.
1. Impute missing values in the dataset columns
2. Remove duplicate rows from the DataFrame. 
3. Create new features if needed (e.g., extract year and month from the 'date' column). 
4. Explore unique countries in the dataset and count the total number of countries. 
Activity 3: Worldwide COVID-19 Overview 
Providing a global and temporal perspective on COVID-19, identifying patterns and 
correlations crucial for strategic decision-making.
1. Visualize the WHO Regions with total COVID-19 cases and total deaths by using bar plots. 
2. Explore the world wide monthly trend of COVID-19 cases using a line plot. 
3. Investigate the correlation between total cases and total deaths using a heatmap.. 
4. Analyze how total cases have evolved over time for a specific location (e.g., India). 
Activity 4: Regional Analysis
Unveiling regional nuances in COVID-19 dynamics and identifying patterns in case 
distribution and fatality across time and continents.
1. Create a grouped bar chart to visualize new cases by continent and month.
2. Visualize the distribution of total COVID-19 cases by year using a box plot.
3. Compare total deaths across different continents using a bar plot. 
4. Analyze the total cases on a month-by-month basis using a bar plot. 
Activity 5: Time Series Analysis
Capturing the daily dynamics of COVID-19, assessing the impact of vaccination, and monitoring 
testing metrics for a comprehensive global overview.
1. Explore the daily trend of new cases and new deaths globally using line plots. 
2. Calculate and visualise the daily average of new cases and deaths globally. 
3. Explore the trend of vaccination coverage over time globally. 
4. Analyze the total tests and positive rate over time globally. 
Activity 6: In-Depth Country Analysis 
Conducting an in-depth examination of specific countries, understanding the correlation 
between cases and deaths globally, and exploring continental variations in case distribution.
1. Visualize a specific country's total COVID-19 cases and deaths over time. 
2. Get user input for the country and metric (total_cases or total_deaths) and plot a line chart 
for the user-selected values.
3. Analyze the distribution of total cases across different continents using a box plot. 
4. Visualize the Year wise monthly trend of new COVID-19 cases for user's selected country. 
Activity 7: Additional Insights 
Extracting additional insights, examining the influence of external factors, and evaluating 
regional disparities for a holistic understanding of the COVID-19 landscape.
1. Visualize the fatality rate (total deaths / total cases) over time globally. 
2. Explore the positivity rate (total_cases/ total tests) versus total tests conducted to analyse 
testing effectiveness using the x-axis as the logarithmic scale for better visualisation.
3. Analyze the fatality rate and its relationship with smoking (Use male_smokers and 
female_smokers columns). 
4. Create a heatmap to analyse the relationship between hospital beds per thousand and 
fatality rate.
6. Project Evidence 
The Learner must submit the following evidence. 
A Project Report which comprises of the screen shots of each activity to show that the Tasks 
of each activity has been executed correctly. 
 
7. Project Guidelines 
You should follow the below guidelines while implementing the Project: 
➢ Implement the project in the technical environment specified in the Project brief.
➢ Follow the format specified for Project Report 
➢ The project report should be submitted at least 1 days before the date of Summative 
Assessment date.
➢ Present the Milestones in every Tutoring Session and seek the Tutor’s feedback and 
review. Incorporate the feedback in your project. 
➢ Attach all project evidence for each milestone as part of your Project report.
 
8. Project Technical Environment 
The Learner should perform the project using Colab/Jupyter notebook, Python, and the 
specified dataset.
